# automa Core Specification

> Status: **accepted** — ratified normative spec for v1; Go is the reference implementation.
> Version: **core model v1**

This document is the **normative, language-neutral** specification for automa's
core saga model: the step lifecycle, the workflow execution loop, execution and
rollback modes, composability, the state model, and the report tree. It is the
foundation every conformant implementation (Go first, then others) MUST satisfy.
The [durability spec](durability-spec.md) is an **extension** layered on top of
this core.

Conformance keywords (**MUST**, **SHOULD**, **MAY**, …) are interpreted per
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119); see [README](README.md).

This spec is **derived from** the Go reference implementation but is written to
be correct in its own right. Where it intentionally departed from the original
Go behavior, the decision is called out inline:

> **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #NN).** … adopted by the reference
> implementation.

A consolidated list of such decisions is in §11; the Go reference implementation
now conforms to all of them.

---

## 1. Scope

This spec covers the **single-process, sequential saga** model:

- Steps and their lifecycle (§3).
- Workflows: an ordered list of steps, executed in order, compensated in reverse
  (§4, §5).
- Execution modes and rollback modes (§5).
- Composability: a workflow is itself a step (§6).
- The state model and its serialization contract (§7).
- The report tree and its serialization contract (§8).
- Registry of step builders (§9).

It does **not** cover (each MAY be a separate, versioned spec later): durability
and resume (see [durability-spec.md](durability-spec.md)), timeouts, retries,
backoff, parallel/concurrent step execution, distributed execution, signals.

## 2. Terminology

- **Implementation** — a language binding of automa.
- **Step** — the smallest unit of work; has a unique ID and up to three lifecycle
  phases (§3).
- **Workflow** — a step that owns an ordered list of child steps and drives their
  execution (§4). A workflow IS a step (§6).
- **Topology** — the ordered list of a workflow's child step IDs, plus its
  execution mode and rollback mode.
- **Report** — the structured, serializable record of an outcome (§8).
- **State bag** — a key-value store; **namespaced state bag** — the partitioned
  per-step view of state (§7).
- **Compensation / rollback** — undoing a completed step's work.

## 3. Step

### 3.1 Identity

- Every step MUST have a non-empty, unique **ID** within its owning workflow.
- An implementation MUST reject (at build/validation time) a workflow containing
  a step with an empty ID or a duplicate ID.

### 3.2 Lifecycle phases

A step has three phases. Each is OPTIONAL to define; an undefined phase has the
default behavior below.

| Phase | Purpose | If not defined |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Prepare** | Enrich context, validate preconditions, pre-populate local state. Runs before Execute. | No-op; context passes through unchanged. |
| **Execute** | Perform the step's primary work. Produce a report. | **Not allowed** — a step MUST define Execute (§3.2.1). |
| **Rollback** | Undo Execute's work (compensation). | No-op; produces a **skipped** outcome. |

#### 3.2.1 Execute is required

- A step **MUST** define an Execute function. A step without Execute is invalid
  and MUST be rejected at build/validation time (alongside the empty/duplicate-ID
  checks of §3.1). This matches the principle that every step is a unit of *work*;
  no-op grouping is expressed with a sub-workflow (§6), not an empty step.
- The `skipped` status (§3.4) therefore arises only when a step's own Execute
  logic decides no work is needed (e.g. "already provisioned"), or when an
  undefined Rollback runs — never from a missing Execute.

### 3.3 Phase contract

- **Prepare** receives an execution context and returns a (possibly enriched)
  context plus an optional error. A non-nil error MUST abort the step and be
  treated by the workflow as a **step failure** (§5).
  - The context returned by Prepare MUST be the context passed to that step's
    Execute (and, where applicable, Rollback).
- **Execute** receives the prepared context and MUST produce a non-nil report.
  - If an implementation's Execute can return "no report," the engine MUST
    synthesize a **failure** report rather than treat it as success.
- **Rollback** receives the context and MUST produce a non-nil report; a missing
  report MUST be synthesized as a **failure**.
- **Rollback MUST be idempotent** — it MAY be invoked more than once for the same
  step (e.g. a manual rollback after an automatic one, or a resumed compensation
  under the durability extension).

### 3.4 Step outcome (status)

Every phase produces a report with exactly one **status**:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `success` | The phase completed without error. |
| `failed` | The phase encountered an error. |
| `skipped` | The phase performed no work (e.g. no Execute defined, or the step determined the work was already done). |

- A report is **failed** if its status is `failed` **or** it carries a non-nil
  error. (Status `success` with an attached error MUST be treated as failed.)
- A report is **successful** only if status is `success` **and** it carries no
  error.
- `skipped` is **not** a failure: the workflow continues past a skipped step.

### 3.5 Single-use and statefulness

- A step instance is **single-use within one workflow execution**: it is owned
  and driven by exactly one execution at a time and MUST NOT be shared across
  concurrent executions.
- The engine attaches a per-step state view to the step before Prepare (§7.3).

  > **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #81).** The Go `Step` interface
  > previously documented `WithState` as returning "a shallow copy of the step,"
  > but both concrete implementations mutate in place and return the same
  > instance. This spec does **not** require copy-on-attach; it requires only
  > that, after the engine attaches state to a step, calls to that step's
  > `State()` observe the attached bag, and that step instances are single-use
  > (above). The misleading "shallow copy" wording was corrected to match this
  > contract in #81.

## 4. Workflow execution

### 4.1 Ordering

- A workflow executes its steps **strictly sequentially**, in topology order,
  one at a time. There is no concurrency between steps in core model v1.
- Compensation (rollback) proceeds in **reverse** topology order.

### 4.2 Workflow-level prepare

- A workflow MAY define a workflow-level prepare hook, run once before any step.
- If the workflow-level prepare fails, **no steps execute** and **no rollback
  occurs** (nothing has run yet). The workflow produces a failure report whose
  action is **prepare** (§8.3).

### 4.3 Per-step execution loop

For each step at index `i` in topology order:

1. Construct and attach the step's state view (§7.3).
2. Run the step's Prepare.
   - On Prepare failure → record a **failed** step report (action = **prepare**,
     see decision below) and apply the execution mode (§5) as for any failure.

     > **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #92).** The Go loop previously
     > recorded a step-Prepare failure with action **execute**. This spec requires
     > action **prepare** for a Prepare-phase failure, so the report faithfully
     > identifies the phase that failed. Adapted in #92.
3. Run the step's Execute; collect its report. (Execute is always defined, §3.2.1.)
4. Apply the execution mode based on the report's failed/not-failed status (§5).

### 4.4 Workflow result

- A workflow report is **successful** iff every executed step is non-failed
  (success or skipped).
- Otherwise the workflow report is **failed** and MUST include the IDs of the
  failed steps and the per-step reports (§8).

## 5. Execution and rollback modes

Two independent modes are configured per workflow. Both are serialized as the
lowercase strings below.

### 5.1 Execution mode

`execution_mode` governs what happens when a step's Execute (or Prepare) fails.

| Value (string) | On step failure |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `stop` | Halt immediately. Skip all remaining steps. **No rollback.** (Default.) |
| `continue` | Record the failure and **continue** executing remaining steps. No rollback. The workflow result is failed if any step failed. |
| `rollback` | Halt, then **compensate** the failed step and all previously executed steps in reverse order (§5.3), then stop. |

- The default execution mode is `stop`.
- The exact decision is a pure function of `(execution_mode, step failed?)`:

```
step failed?  no  → proceed to next step (any mode)
step failed?  yes → stop      : break, no rollback
                    continue  : continue to next step
                    rollback  : run compensation from i..0, then break
```

### 5.2 Rollback mode

`rollback_mode` governs what happens when a **compensation** (a step's Rollback)
itself fails, during a `rollback`-mode compensation pass.

| Value (string) | On compensation failure |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| `continue` | Continue compensating the remaining (lower-index) steps. (Default.) |
| `stop` | Stop the compensation pass immediately. |

- The default rollback mode is `continue`.
- `rollback_mode` is only consulted when `execution_mode` is `rollback`.

  > **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #93).** Go's `TypeMode` previously
  > allowed `rollback` as a *rollback_mode* value (the enum is shared). This spec
  > restricts `rollback_mode` to `{ continue, stop }`; `rollback` as a
  > rollback_mode is meaningless and is rejected at validation time. Adapted in #93.

### 5.3 Compensation pass

When `execution_mode` is `rollback` and step `i` fails:

1. Compensation runs from index `i` down to `0` (the **failed step is included**,
   so it can clean up partial work it performed before failing).
2. Each step's Rollback receives that step's **execution-time state snapshot**
   (§7.4), not the current live state.
3. A step that was **skipped** (never executed) MUST NOT be compensated; its
   Rollback MUST NOT be invoked.

   > **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #84).** The Go `rollbackFrom` loop
   > previously invoked `Rollback` on *every* step from `i` down to `0`
   > unconditionally (a no-op Rollback merely returns skipped, but a *defined*
   > Rollback on a step whose Execute never ran would still fire). This spec
   > requires compensation to be limited to steps that actually executed
   > (status `success` or `failed`), never `skipped`/`pending` steps. This is
   > also required for correct durability resume. Adapted in #84: the engine now
   > tracks per-step execution and skips non-executed steps.

4. Each compensation produces a rollback report; these are attached under the
   corresponding step's report (§8.2).
5. **Compensate at most once.** Each executed step is compensated **at most once**
   per rollback of a given workflow run. An implementation MUST track per-step
   compensation state and MUST NOT invoke a step's Rollback again once that step
   has been compensated. This is enforced by the engine at the orchestration
   level; the "Rollback MUST be idempotent" contract (§3) is a backstop for
   distinct invocations (e.g. durability resume, §5.4), not a licence to
   double-compensate within a single run. For sub-workflow steps this rule has a
   specific consequence spelled out in §6 (nested compensation) and D10.

   > This tracking (and all per-step rollback bookkeeping: execution-time state
   > snapshots, the executed-step set, and rollback reports) is keyed by **step
   > ID**. It is therefore correct only because step IDs are **unique within a
   > workflow and non-empty** (§3.1 / D9). Relaxing D9 would silently corrupt
   > compensation — two same-ID steps in one workflow would share a snapshot and
   > a compensated-once flag. D10 depends on D9.

### 5.4 Manual rollback

- An implementation MAY expose a direct "rollback the whole workflow" operation
  independent of an execution failure.
- If invoked, it compensates steps in reverse order using the most recent
  execution-time snapshots if available, otherwise the current workflow state.
- The §5.3 rule (do not compensate non-executed steps) applies equally.

## 6. Composability

- A workflow **is** a step: it satisfies the same lifecycle contract (§3) and
  MAY be included as a child step of another workflow.
- A nested (sub-)workflow:
  - Receives an **isolated** view of state: a fresh local namespace and a
    **deep clone** of the parent's global namespace (§7.3). Mutations inside the
    sub-workflow MUST NOT propagate back to the parent's global state.
  - Produces a workflow report that nests as one entry in the parent's
    `StepReports` (§8.2).
#### 6.1 Mode inheritance

- A nested workflow **inherits its parent's** execution mode and rollback mode:
  during assembly, the parent's modes are propagated to its child workflows **at
  every depth** (cascaded root→leaf), so the entire tree executes under one
  consistent error-handling policy.
- This is a deliberate uniformity guarantee: an operator configuring a top-level
  workflow as `rollback` gets rollback semantics throughout the tree without
  having to set the mode on every nested workflow.
- A nested workflow's modes as configured on its own builder are therefore
  advisory: they MAY be set for documentation or for standalone execution of that
  workflow, but when it runs as a child its parent's modes apply.

  > **Future direction (#124, non-normative).** A proposal exists to let a child
  > *tighten* the error-handling policy but never *loosen* it (effective mode =
  > the stricter of parent and child, on the order `continue < stop < rollback`),
  > so a reusable sub-workflow can guarantee its own atomicity without weakening
  > the operator's runtime decision. If inheritance is ever relaxed it MUST only
  > permit tightening, never loosening. Not adopted for v1; parent-overrides is
  > the whole model here.

  > **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #82, #123).** The Go `WorkflowBuilder`
  > doc comment previously contradicted the actual overwrite behavior; the
  > behavior (parent overrides) is correct per this spec and the doc comment was
  > corrected in #82. That fix only reached **direct** children, though: a child
  > was built (stamping its own default modes onto its grandchildren) before the
  > parent could override it, so nesting deeper than one level did not inherit.
  > #123 replaced the per-child stamp with a root→leaf cascade so inheritance
  > holds at every depth (see `deeply_nested_inherits_modes`).

- **Nested compensation.** A sub-workflow compensates its **own** steps (§5.3).
  When a parent's compensation pass reaches a child-workflow step, it drives the
  child's compensation only for steps the child has **not already compensated**,
  so each executed step is compensated exactly once (§5.3.5, D10):
  - A child that **succeeded** never self-compensated. When a *later sibling*
    fails, the parent's rollback pass MUST compensate the child (rolling back the
    child's leaf steps in reverse). See `nested_workflow_rollback_propagation`.
  - A child that **failed** under the inherited `rollback` mode has already
    self-compensated its executed steps by the time it returns. The parent MUST
    NOT compensate those steps again — the parent's compensation of that child
    step is a no-op. Because compensation happens at the level closest to the
    failure, this holds at any nesting depth: a leaf failure deep in the tree is
    compensated once, not once per enclosing level. See
    `nested_workflow_failed_sub_compensated_once` and
    `deeply_nested_failed_leaf_compensated_once`.

  The parent still compensates its **own** other executed steps normally. How a
  nested rollback report is represented under the parent is defined in §8.2.

## 7. State model

### 7.1 State bag

- A **state bag** is a key-value store (string keys → arbitrary values).
- It MUST support: get (raw), set, delete, clear, list keys, size, snapshot of
  items, merge, and deep clone.
- It MUST be serializable to and from a language-neutral object form (§7.5).

### 7.2 Namespaces

A **namespaced state bag** partitions state into exactly two namespaces:

| Namespace | Visibility |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Local** | Private to one step. Never visible to any other step. |
| **Global** | Shared across all steps in a workflow. Writes by one step are visible to subsequent steps. |

- These two are the whole model: **Local** for step-private scratch, **Global**
  for intentional cross-step sharing. There is no third, named partition.
- **Global does not prevent collisions.** Multiple steps writing the same key in
  Global overwrite each other. Authors SHOULD use distinct keys to publish data
  for a later step, and MAY deliberately overwrite when a set of cooperating steps
  intentionally shares a mutable value (e.g. a counter or status). The engine does
  not arbitrate keys.

> **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #NN).** An earlier revision specified a
> third "custom named room" namespace (`WithNamespace`). It was removed: a named
> room provided nothing that Global with a distinct key does not — it did not
> prevent overwrites *within* the room, so authors needed unique keys either way —
> and it added a third cross-language concept for no capability gain. Local +
> Global is the minimal, unambiguous model. (Removes the former decision D8 and
> resolves review issue #83 by removal.)

### 7.3 State injection (per step)

Before a step's Prepare, the engine MUST attach a namespaced state bag built as
follows:

- **Ordinary step:** fresh empty **Local**; the workflow's **Global** bag shared
  by reference, so writes are visible to later steps.
- **Sub-workflow step:** fresh empty **Local**; a *deep clone* of the workflow's
  **Global** bag, so the sub-workflow inherits the parent's Global state at entry
  but its mutations MUST NOT propagate back to the parent (isolation, per §6).

### 7.4 Execution-time snapshots

- After each step is processed (whether it succeeded or failed), the engine
  SHOULD capture a **deep-cloned snapshot** of that step's state (Local + Global
  at that moment), keyed by step ID, for use during compensation (§5.3).
- Snapshot capture MAY be disabled as an optimization. When disabled,
  compensation receives the current workflow (global) state instead of a
  per-step snapshot, and per-step Local namespaces are not available during
  compensation. Implementations that offer this toggle MUST document the
  tradeoff. (Default: snapshots enabled.)
- If snapshot cloning fails, the engine MUST NOT fail the step for that reason
  alone; it SHOULD fall back to retaining a non-cloned reference and log a
  warning, so that compensation can still be attempted.

### 7.5 Serialization contract (cross-language)

This is the part most likely to diverge across languages and is therefore
normative:

- A state bag serializes to a JSON object: key (string) → value.
- After a JSON round-trip, numeric values MAY be decoded as floating point.
  Implementations MUST provide **coercing typed accessors** (integer, float,
  bool, string) that recover the intended type from the round-tripped value.
- **Numeric precision policy (normative).** JSON has a single number type, and a
  round-trip through floating point represents integers with a unique value only
  up to 2^53−1 (the max *safe* integer; 2^53 is representable but 2^53+1 is not).
  Values beyond the safe range (e.g. large 64-bit IDs) CANNOT be guaranteed to
  survive a round-trip as numbers across languages.
  - For values that must round-trip losslessly and exceed the safe integer
    range, authors SHOULD store them as **strings** (e.g. a 64-bit ID as
    `"9007199254740993"`), and use the string accessor to read them back.
  - Implementations MUST document this limitation prominently. An author who
    stores a large value as a JSON *number* accepts the precision risk; the
    engine does not silently widen or arbitrate.
  - The exact safe-integer boundary and the recommended string convention MUST be
    shared as conformance fixtures so every language agrees on the cutoff.
- `null` / nil values MUST be storable and MUST be distinguishable from an absent
  key.

### 7.6 Reference

The existing design docs `state-serialization.md`, `state-numeric-boundaries.md`,
and `state-preservation.md` describe the Go behavior. The normative cross-language
rules (and their fixtures) are owned by this spec; those docs are the rationale.

## 8. Report

The report is automa's primary observability primitive and a key differentiator:
it is a fully serializable tree describing an entire run. Its schema is therefore
a cross-language contract.

### 8.1 Report fields

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `id` | string | The step or workflow ID that produced the report. |
| `isWorkflow` | bool | True if produced by a workflow. |
| `action` | string | Phase that produced it: `prepare` / `execute` / `rollback`. |
| `status` | string | `success` / `failed` / `skipped`. |
| `startTime`, `endTime` | RFC 3339 string (ms precision, tz designator) | Phase wall-clock bounds, e.g. `2026-06-17T10:30:00.123Z` (§10.4). |
| `detail` | string, optional | Human-readable context. |
| `error` | string, optional | Failure message (the error rendered as a string). |
| `metadata` | object, optional | String→string structured diagnostics. |
| `steps` | array, optional | Child step reports (workflow reports only), in execution order. |
| `rollback` | object, optional | Nested rollback report tree (§8.2). |
| `executionMode`, `rollbackMode` | string, optional | Modes in effect when produced. |

- `action`, `status`, `executionMode`, and `rollbackMode` MUST serialize as the
  lowercase string forms defined in this spec, never as numeric ordinals.

  > **✓ Spec decision (Go conforms as of #94).** Go's `TypeAction` and
  > `TypeStatus` previously mapped *unknown* string values to a default on
  > unmarshal (`action`→`prepare`, etc.), unlike `TypeMode` which errors. For a
  > cross-language wire contract this is unsafe: an unknown enum value MUST be a
  > decode error, not a silent default, so format drift is caught. Adapted in #94:
  > all three enums now fail on unknown values.

### 8.2 Nesting

- A **workflow report** nests its per-step reports under `steps`, in execution
  order.
- When a step is itself a sub-workflow, that sub-workflow's report is the entry
  under the parent's `steps`.
- When compensation runs, the rollback outcomes are nested under the `rollback`
  field of the report for the step that triggered the rollback. The rollback
  report is itself a (workflow-shaped) report whose `steps` are the per-step
  rollback reports, in compensation order (reverse execution order).

### 8.3 Action and status invariants

- A `prepare`-phase failure MUST carry action `prepare` (§4.3 decision).
- An `execute`-phase report MUST carry action `execute`.
- A rollback report MUST carry action `rollback`.
- `isFailed` ≡ (`status == failed`) OR (`error` present).
- `isSuccess` ≡ (`status == success`) AND (no `error`).

## 9. Registry (optional component)

- A **registry** is a thread-safe store of named step **builders**, enabling
  workflows to be assembled by ID rather than by direct constructor reference.
- Registry semantics:
  - Adding a builder whose ID already exists MUST fail, and a batch add MUST be
    atomic (all-or-nothing).
  - Lookups by ID return the builder or a not-found indication.
- The registry is OPTIONAL for conformance; it is an assembly convenience, not
  part of the execution model.

## 10. Open questions

**Resolved (folded into the spec):**

1. **Custom namespaces (§7.2).** *Resolved:* removed. The state model is Local +
   Global only; a named partition added no capability over a distinct Global key.
   (Resolves review issue #83 by removal.)
2. **Numeric precision boundaries (§7.5).** *Resolved:* document the 2^53
   boundary; recommend string-typed numerics for values beyond it; authors using
   JSON numbers accept the risk.
3. **Metadata value typing (§8.1).** *Resolved:* `string → string` (matches
   solo-provisioner usage; maximizes portability).
4. **Timestamp format (§8.1).** *Resolved:* `startTime`/`endTime` serialize as
   **RFC 3339 / ISO 8601 strings with millisecond precision and a timezone
   designator** (e.g. `2026-06-17T10:30:00.123Z`).
5. **Sub-workflow rollback report shape (§8.2).** *Resolved:* a compensated child
   workflow's rollback report nests **inline** under the parent step's `rollback`
   field, recursively — a child's rollback is itself a workflow-shaped report.
6. **Double-compensation of nested steps (§5.3, §6).** *Resolved:* an executed
   step is compensated at most once per run (D10). A failed sub-workflow
   self-compensates; the parent MUST NOT compensate it again. The engine
   previously re-compensated nested steps once per enclosing level. (Resolves
   #122.)

**Still open:**

- None blocking core v1. (Conformance fixtures must encode the numeric boundary
  and the timestamp format precisely; see §12.)

## 11. Consolidated spec decisions

Each is a place where this spec is written "the right way" and the Go reference
implementation is (or is being) adapted to match.

**Adapted — Go now conforms:**

| # | Decision | § | Adapted in |
|---|----------|----|-----------|
| D1 | A step **MUST** define Execute; a no-execute step is a validation error. | 3.2.1 | already matched (docs only) |
| D2 | `WithState` contract: attach-and-observe + single-use; fix the misleading "shallow copy" docs. | 3.5 | #81 |
| D3 | Step **Prepare** failure reports action `prepare`, not `execute`. | 4.3 | #92 |
| D4 | `rollback_mode` restricted to `{ continue, stop }`; reject `rollback`. | 5.2 | #93 |
| D5 | Compensation MUST skip non-executed (`skipped`/`pending`) steps. | 5.3 | #84 |
| D6 | Nested workflows **inherit** the parent's modes (parent overrides) **at every depth**; fix the contradicting builder doc comment. | 6.1 | #82, #123 |
| D7 | Report enums (`action`, `status`) MUST fail on unknown values on decode, like `mode`. | 8.1 | #94 |
| D8 | *(withdrawn)* An earlier revision specified custom namespaces as workflow-scoped shared named rooms. The feature was **removed** instead (§7.2): Local + Global is the whole model. | 7.2 | removed |
| D9 | Duplicate step IDs **MUST** be rejected at build time; the original Go builder silently dropped them (first-wins). | 3.1 | #120 |
| D10 | An executed step is compensated **at most once** per run. A parent MUST NOT re-compensate a sub-workflow that already self-compensated (a failed child under the inherited `rollback` mode); the parent still compensates its own other steps. Enforced via per-step compensation tracking keyed by step ID, so **D10 depends on D9** (unique, non-empty IDs). The engine originally double-compensated nested steps once per enclosing level. | 5.3, 6 | #122 |

All spec decisions are now reflected in the Go reference implementation.

## 12. Conformance

- Cross-language agreement is verified by shared fixtures under
  `docs/spec/conformance/`, of two kinds:
  - **Behavior fixtures** — a workflow definition (steps with declared
    success/fail/skip outcomes) + the expected report tree and execution order,
    for each mode combination. These verify §4–§6 and §8 identically across
    implementations without real side effects.
  - **Serialization fixtures** — state bags and report trees in JSON that every
    implementation MUST load and re-serialize equivalently (§7.5, §8).
- The **Go** implementation is the first conformant implementation and a
  reference, not the definition. A divergence between Go behavior and this spec
  is a Go bug, not a spec amendment.
