# Conformance fixtures

Language-neutral fixtures that define correct automa behavior. Every conformant
implementation (Go first, then Kotlin/Python/Rust/…) MUST pass **these same
fixtures, unchanged**. They are the source of truth for cross-language
agreement; the prose specs ([core](../core-spec.md), [durability](../durability-spec.md))
are the rationale.

> **Rule:** adding or changing a specified behavior REQUIRES adding or updating a
> fixture here. A spec change without a fixture change is incomplete.

Fixtures are plain JSON with no language dependency. The Go reference harness
lives in [`conformance_test.go`](https://github.com/automa-saga/automa/blob/main/conformance_test.go) and runs every
fixture under `go test`.

## Versioning

The fixture set is versioned in [`manifest.json`](manifest.json). It declares the
`automa-spec` release version and, per **profile** (`core`, `durability`, …), the
profile version, status, owning spec doc, covered on-disk wire-format versions,
and the fixture globs that belong to it. An implementation claims conformance to a
`{ profile: version }` set; for each profile it implements it MUST be at the latest
released version. The full semver rules and governance (the AIP change process and
the published conformance matrix) are tracked in
[automa#128](https://github.com/automa-saga/automa/issues/128).

## Layout

```
docs/spec/conformance/
  behavior/        # workflow execution outcomes (core-spec §4–§6, §8)
  serialization/   # load → re-serialize round-trips (core-spec §7.5, §8)
  journal/         # durability journal round-trips (durability-spec §3, §8)
```

## Behavior fixtures (`behavior/*.json`)

A workflow definition whose steps have **declared outcomes**, plus the expected
observable result. The harness builds the workflow, runs it with no real side
effects, and asserts the execution/rollback order and the report tree.

```json
{
  "name": "stop_on_error_halts",
  "description": "StopOnError stops at the first failure and runs no rollback.",
  "specRefs": ["§5.1"],
  "workflow": {
    "id": "wf",
    "executionMode": "stop",          // stop | continue | rollback
    "rollbackMode": "continue",       // continue | stop
    "steps": [
      { "id": "s1", "execute": "success" },
      { "id": "s2", "execute": "failed" },
      { "id": "s3", "execute": "success" }
    ]
  },
  "expect": {
    "workflowStatus": "failed",        // success | failed | skipped
    "executionOrder": ["s1", "s2"],    // leaf steps that ran Execute, in order
    "rollbackOrder": [],               // leaf steps that ran Rollback, in order
    "steps": {                          // per-step report assertions (subset ok)
      "s1": { "status": "success", "action": "execute" },
      "s2": { "status": "failed",  "action": "execute" }
    }
  }
}
```

Step fields:

- **Leaf step:** `execute` is `success` | `failed` | `skipped`. `rollback` is
  `success` | `failed` (default `success`). `prepare` is `""` (ok) | `failed`;
  a failed Prepare means the step never Executes.
- **Sub-workflow step:** provide a non-empty `steps` array (and optionally its
  own `executionMode` / `rollbackMode`); `prepare`/`execute`/`rollback` are then
  ignored. A workflow is a step (core-spec §6), so nesting is recursive.

Expectations:

- `executionOrder` / `rollbackOrder` list **leaf** step IDs in the order their
  Execute / Rollback ran (a sub-workflow contributes its leaves, flattened).
- `steps[id]` asserts a subset of that step's report: `status`, `action`, and
  `rollbackStatus` (the status of the step's rollback sub-report). Omitted keys
  are not asserted. Steps absent from the map are not asserted, so fixtures need
  not enumerate steps that never produced a report.

## Serialization fixtures (`serialization/*.json`)

A canonical JSON document that every implementation MUST load and re-serialize
to an equivalent document (structural equality; key order and whitespace do not
matter).

```json
{
  "name": "statebag_numeric_boundary",
  "description": "Safe integers round-trip; larger IDs use strings (core-spec §7.5).",
  "specRefs": ["§7.5"],
  "kind": "statebag",
  "json": {
    "local":  {},
    "global": { "safeInt": 9007199254740992, "bigId": "9007199254740993" }
  }
}
```

- `kind` is one of:
  - `statebag` — the namespaced state bag (`local` + `global`, core-spec §7.2).
    Both namespace keys are always present, even when empty.
  - `report` — a report tree (core-spec §8): step and workflow reports, nested
    `steps`, an inline `rollback` sub-report, RFC 3339 millisecond timestamps,
    and error-as-string.
- **Numeric precision (§7.5):** JSON has one number type; a round-trip through
  IEEE-754 double is exact only for integers with magnitude ≤ 2^53−1 (the max
  *safe* integer — the largest with a unique double representation). 2^53 itself
  is representable, but 2^53+1 is not, so values beyond the safe range MUST be
  stored as strings to survive losslessly. Fixtures encode the safe-integer case,
  the 2^53 boundary, and the string-encoded unsafe-ID case.
- **Timestamps (§8):** serialize as RFC 3339 with a timezone designator;
  trailing-zero fractional seconds are trimmed (e.g. `...00.5Z`, not `...00.500Z`).

## Journal fixtures (`journal/*.json`)

Durability journal fixtures, governed by the
[durability spec](../durability-spec.md). Each has a `kind`:

- `roundtrip` — a `journal` document that every implementation MUST load and
  re-serialize to a structurally-equivalent document (key order and whitespace
  do not matter), verifying **schema agreement** (durability-spec §3, §8.1).
- `resume` — a `journal` plus an `expect` block describing how a conformant
  resume MUST classify it: `reExecute` (leaf steps that run forward on resume),
  `compensate` (leaf steps whose rollback runs), and `workflowStatus`. Steps in
  the topology absent from `reExecute` are skipped as already `completed`. This
  verifies **resume decision agreement** (§6) without real side effects — the Go
  harness drives the real `ResumeWorkflow` with recording steps.

```json
{
  "name": "journal_flat_forward_in_progress",
  "description": "A flat run mid-forward …",
  "specRefs": ["§3.3", "§3.4", "§5"],
  "kind": "roundtrip",
  "journal": {
    "version": 1,
    "workflow_id": "setup_local_dev",
    "execution_mode": "rollback",       // TypeMode wire form: stop | continue | rollback
    "rollback_mode":  "continue",       // TypeMode wire form: stop | continue
    "cursor": { "phase": "forward", "index": 1 },
    "shared": { "local": {}, "global": { "region": "us-east-1" } },
    "steps": [
      { "id": "create-network", "state": "completed",
        "snapshot": { "local": {}, "global": {} } },
      { "id": "create-db",  "state": "started" },
      { "id": "deploy-app", "state": "pending" }
    ]
  }
}
```

- **Modes** use automa's existing `TypeMode` JSON encoding — the short lowercase
  strings `stop` / `continue` / `rollback` — the same form the behavior and
  report fixtures use. The journal reuses `TypeMode`, not a second wire form.
- **Workflow-node invariant (§3.3/§3.8):** a node is a workflow **iff** its entry
  has a `steps` array; whenever `steps` is present, `cursor` and `shared` are too.
  A leaf step carries none of the three. A workflow step omits the leaf
  `snapshot`. The structure is recursive to arbitrary depth.
- **`report` / `snapshot` / `shared`** nest their own existing schemas (report
  tree, namespaced state bag); journal fixtures constrain only their placement.
- **Resume-classification fixtures** (a journal plus the expected phase,
  first-incomplete index, and which steps re-run vs. skip) land with the resume
  story; they verify the §6 decision logic without running side effects.
